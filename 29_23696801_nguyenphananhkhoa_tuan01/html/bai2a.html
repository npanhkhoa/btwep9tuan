        <h2> Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h2>
        <p>
            The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,
            <b>Leonhard Euler</b>
            was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant <br>
            of mathematics,<b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler <br>
            was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and <br>
            astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</cite> (1748) remained a standard textbook for well <br>
            over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <cite>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</cite> (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical <br>
            outline of the main physical theories of the time.
        </p>

        <p>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps <br>
            best known for his research into mathematical analysis.
            Euler's formula
        </p>

        <p>
            cos(x) + isin(x) = e <sup>(ix)</sup>
        </p>
        demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's
        easy to derive the equation
        <p>
        e<sup>(&pi; i) </sup>+ 1 = 0
        </p>

        <p> which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.</p>
        
        <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the
            annals of mathematics.
